# 🌟 Spring Batch + Quartz Scheduler + PostgreSQL + NGINX + LocalStack (S3) 🌟

Welcome to the Spring Batch + Quartz Scheduler project! This repository demonstrates a production-ready, containerized
development environment for building, scheduling, and running batch jobs with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3 (via
LocalStack). 🚀

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Core application framework
- **Spring Batch**: For batch processing and job scheduling
- **Quartz Scheduler**: Advanced job scheduling and management
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for persistent storage
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy for the Spring Boot application
- **LocalStack**: Local AWS S3 mock for testing cloud integrations
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates all services into a unified environment

---

## 🎯 Features

- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently process large datasets using Spring Batch
- **Job Scheduling**: Schedule and manage jobs with Quartz Scheduler
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Upload, list, and manage files in a mock S3 bucket
- **Containerized Environment**: Fully Dockerized setup for local development
- **Scalable Architecture**: Spring Boot app runs with 3 replicas for load balancing
